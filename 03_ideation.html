      <p class="smallp">
        Record your computer screen <b>during Ideation and Design</b>. In stage 1, Ideation, you will probably sketch by hand. That's ok, we are interested in the web searches you do to inform or inspire your design. Later you will also submit scans or pictures of your sketches and we will analyse them too.

        Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TidEkPsiXzA" target="_blank">this Quicktime recording tutorial</a>. If you are a Mac user, you already have Quicktime installed. If you are a Windows user, download and install Quicktime or use another screen recording app of your choice.  Think out loud if you feel comfortable so we can better understand your thought process.
