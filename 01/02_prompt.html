        <h1>Design exercise prompt.<span class="warning">  Read carefully! :-)</span></h1>
        <p>We challenge you to create a new feature for <b>Facebook</b>. People might want to post a question, or ask for help in various situations — maybe they want a friend's help to take care of their pets when they are about to travel, or for more serious affairs, for example they discovered someone in their family has a disease, or their car was robbed. The feature you will create intends on maximizing the number of comments or messages connected to posts like this — <b><i>when someone asks for help</i></b>.</p>

        <p>You will have <b>one week</b> to execute the 3 stages below. You can take on them in separate days or in a single-shot, as you wish! We suggest the following schedule, which can and should be adapted to your needs, constraints or design process:</p>
        <div class="row box">
          <b>1. Ideation » 1 hour.</b> Generate ideas and sketches for the feature design. These can be both short sentences or drawings. The ideas and sketches can be rough, low-fidelity, however they have to make sense to you, as in the final stage we will ask you to annotate them.
<br/>
          <span class="warning">Take note of how many minutes you spend in this stage.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="row box">
          <b>2. Design » 1 hour.</b> Select one of the ideas from the first stage. You will develop the idea as much as you can, aiming at reaching what you consider to be a finalized design. With this design, the intention is having something that can be shown to other designers and communicate your idea to solve the design challenge.

          <span class="warning">Take note of how many minutes you spend in this stage.</span>
        </div>
        <div class="row box">
          <b>3. Submit » 30 minutes.</b>  Prepare the outcomes of your work to submit us and answer a short survey about the exercise. There are examples of what materials we expect you to submit in the next page, but now focus on the exercise! :-)
