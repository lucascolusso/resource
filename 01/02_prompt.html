        <h1>Design exercise prompt.<span class="warning">  Read carefully! :-)</span></h1>

        <p>We ask you to solve a problem we already identified — you should think about this as a designer, not as a user. Your job is to create a solution for this specific context: Sometimes people use Facebook to ask for help.  E.g. A teenager struggling with her math homework, a friend asking for advice with a relationship issue, or a foreigner trying to understand the American Democrat x Republican debate.</p>

        <p>The challenge is to <i><b>maximize</b></i> the number of answers for posts where <i><b>people are searching for some kind of help</b></i>.</p>

        <p>You will have <b>one week</b> to execute the 3 stages below. You can take on them in separate days or in a single-shot, as you wish! The following schedule is a suggestion; you can fit it to your needs, constraints or preferred design process:</p>

        <ol class="list">
          <li><b>Ideation » 1 hour.</b> Generate ideas and sketches for the feature design. These can be both short sentences or drawings. The ideas and sketches can be rough, low-fidelity, however, they have to make sense to you, as in the final stage we will ask you to annotate them.
              <span class="warning">Please take note of how many minutes you spend in this stage.</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Design » 1 hour.</b> Select the best idea you generated in the first stage. You will develop the idea as much as you can, aiming at reaching what you consider to be a finalized design. With this design, the intention is having something that can be shown to other designers and communicate your idea to solve the design challenge.
              <span class="warning">Please take note of how many minutes you spend in this stage.</span>
          </li>
          <li><b>Submit » 30 minutes.</b>  Prepare the outcomes of your work to submit us and answer a short survey about the exercise. There are examples of what materials we expect you to submit in the next page, but now focus on the exercise! :-)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="warning">Important!</h2>
          <div class="row box">
            <b>Support. </b> We provide this informational resource as a reference to support your design: <a href="../resources/card.pdf" target="_blank">Design card</a>. Click on the link to open the file in a new tab. You can also use other resources to support your design — websites, books, conversations with other people.

          <div class="row box">
            <b>Recording. </b> Record your computer screen <b>during stages 1 and 2</b> of the exercise. In stage 1, Ideation, you will probably sketch by hand. That's ok, we are interested in the searches you do on your browser to inform or inspire your design. Later you will submit scans or pictures of your sketches and we will analyse them too.<br/>
            If you are a Mac user, you already have Quicktime installed. If you are a Windows user, download and install Quicktime or use another screen recording software of your choice. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TidEkPsiXzA">this Quicktime screen recording tutorial</a>.Think out loud if you feel comfortable doing that so we can better understand your thought process.
