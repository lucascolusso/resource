        <h1>Design exercise prompt.<span class="warning">  Read carefully! :-)</span></h1>
        <p>Imagine your are a designer at Facebook. We discovered that Facebook is used by a massive amount of people to ask for <i>help</i>. For example, a teenager struggling with her math homework, a friend asking for advice with a relationship issue, or a foreigner trying to understand the American Democratic x Republican debate.</p>
        <p>You have to create a feature, or modify a feature, to <i><b>maximize</b></i> the number of answers to posts where <i><b>people are searching for some type of help</b></i>.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>You will have <b>one week</b> to complete the exercise. You can take on each proposed step (as seen in the list below) in separate days or in a single-shot, as you wish! The following schedule is a suggestion; you can fit it to your needs, constraints or preferred design process:</p>
          <ol class="list">
            <li><b>Ideation ~ 30 minutes.</b> Generate ideas and sketches for the feature.
            </li>
            <li><b>Design ~ 1 hour.</b> Select the best idea you generated in the first stage and polish it.
            </li>
          </ol>
        <p></p>
        <hr>
        <h2 class="warning">Important!</h2>

            <b>Recording. </b> Record your computer screen <b>during stages 1 and 2</b> of the exercise. In stage 1, Ideation, you will probably sketch by hand. That's ok, we are interested in the searches you do on your browser to inform or inspire your design. Later you will also submit scans or pictures of your sketches and we will analyse them too.<br/>
            If you are a Mac user, you already have Quicktime installed. If you are a Windows user, download and install Quicktime or use another screen recording software of your choice. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TidEkPsiXzA">this Quicktime screen recording tutorial</a>. Think out loud if you feel comfortable doing that so we can better understand your thought process.
