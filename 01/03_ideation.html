      <b>Video.</b> Screen recording of the exercise.
      <b>Recording. </b> Record your computer screen <b>during stages 1 and 2</b> of the exercise. In stage 1, Ideation, you will probably sketch by hand. That's ok, we are interested in the searches you do on your browser to inform or inspire your design. Later you will also submit scans or pictures of your sketches and we will analyse them too.<br/>
      If you are a Mac user, you already have Quicktime installed. If you are a Windows user, download and install Quicktime or use another screen recording software of your choice. Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TidEkPsiXzA">this Quicktime screen recording tutorial</a>. Think out loud if you feel comfortable doing that so we can better understand your thought process.
