    Welcome to the design exercise! Participation typically takes one and a half hours. No personal identifiable information will be collected for analysis. We ask you to generate concepts and sketches of a design and a finalized version of a design and explain your ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you finish your design, you will be asked to send us the outcomes of your work and explain your process and design. It is crucial that you submit all the required assets. After this, you will be asked to answer questions about your experience with the exercise and also about yourself. All responses are confidential, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. The study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Questions in the survey are marked as required. We marked them as required, as skipping some of them would invalidate the results of the questionnaires we use and make it harder for us to compare your responses with responses of others. Please decide on your participation keeping this in mind. If you don't answer a question on purpose, or forgets to do so, the system will provide a warning asking you to consider answering the questions. In this case, the system will also highlight with a different color the text of questions that remain unanswered. As mentioned, you can decide to drop the study at any point, with no risk of penalty or loss of benefits.
