  <p>
    Welcome to the Flappy Bird experiment. Participation in the study typically takes 20 minutes and is strictly anonymous. We ask you to play several rounds of an online video game. You can play as many rounds as you want.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of the game, you will be asked to answer a few questions about your experience with the game and also about youself. All responses are confidential, and in no case will responses from individual participants be identified. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. The study involves no more than minimal risk to participants (i.e., the level of risk encountered in daily life). Participation is voluntary, refusal to take part in the study involves no penalty or loss of benefits to which participants are otherwise entitled.
  </p>
  <p>
  A number of questions in the post-study survey are marked as required. We marked them as required, as skipping some of them would invalidate the results of the questionnaires we use and make it harder for us to compare your responses with responses of others. Please decide on your participation keeping this in mind. If you don't answer a question on purpose, or forgets to do so, the system will provide a warning asking you to consider answering the questions. In this case, the system will also highlight with a different color the text of questions that remain unanswered. As mentioned, you can decide to drop the study at any point, with no risk of penalty or loss of benefits.
