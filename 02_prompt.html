          <p>Imagine you are a designer at Facebook. We discovered that Facebook is used by a massive amount of people to ask for <i>help</i>. For example, a teenager struggling with her math homework or a friend asking for advice with a relationship issue.</p>
          <p>You have to create, or modify, a feature to <i><b>maximize</b></i> the number of answers to posts where <i><b>people are searching for some type of help</b></i> on Facebook.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p class="pfix">
          You will have <b>one week</b> to complete the exercise. You can take on each proposed step (as seen in the list below) in separate days or in a single-shot. After each step there will be a short survey.

            Record your computer screen <b>during Ideation and Design</b>. In stage 1, Ideation, you will probably sketch by hand. That's ok, we are interested in the web searches you do to inform or inspire your design. Later you will also submit scans or pictures of your sketches and we will analyse them too.<br/>

            Follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TidEkPsiXzA">this Quicktime recording tutorial</a>. If you are a Mac user, you already have Quicktime installed. If you are a Windows user, download and install Quicktime or use another screen recording app of your choice.  Think out loud if you feel comfortable so we can better understand your thought process.
